			Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }}!
		</h3>
		<p>
			I am a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS),
			where I work on developer experience.
			My current focus is re-imagining how applications are built and how productive
			developers can be using generative AI, as part of the AWS Next Gen Developer
			Experience org.
			My scope includes Amazon CodeCatalyst, CodeWhisperer, CodeGuru, IDEs, and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout my entire tenure at Amazon, my objective has been delighting developers on AWS.
			Previously at AWS, I worked on AWS Proton, Amazon ECS, and the AWS Code Suite, as well as
			several open source projects including AWS CDK, Spinnaker, and Backstage.
			Before joining Amazon in 2014, I was a software engineer at Motorola Solutions
			working on products in the WiFi technology space. I graduated from the University
			of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
