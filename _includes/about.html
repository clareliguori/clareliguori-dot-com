		Hi, I'm {{ site.author }}!
		<br/>
		I am currently a Principal Software Engineer for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/containers/services/">AWS Container Services</a>.
		I focus on developer tooling and developer experience for Amazon ECS.
		I like to have fun with containers and think about how they fit into
		local development, continuous deployment, observability, and operations.
		<br/><br/>
		Previously, I worked in AWS Developer Tools building CodeBuild and CodeCommit.
		Before joining Amazon, I was a software engineer at Motorola Solutions
		working on products in the WiFi technology space.  I graduated from the University
		of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
