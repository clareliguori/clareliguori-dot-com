I get this question a lot: "What *exactly* does a Principal Engineer do at AWS?"

Every principal engineer I know plays a mix of roles unique to them, so I put
together this rough estimate of how I personally spent my time in 2019, broken
down into a few buckets:

When I put the data into a quarterly view, I found the results to be pretty
interesting. The data turned out to be very aligned to the annual AWS calendar.
Q1 and Q3 is when we do org-level career discussions and talent reviews, so it
makes sense that I spent a lot of time during those quarters on the "Team" 
category. Annual roadmap planning/brainstorming is mostly done in Q2, and so I
spent a lot of time during that quarter on the "Product" category. The AWS 
reInvent conference in Q4 means I spent a lot of time on the "Project" and 
"External" categories in that quarter, trying to get things shipped and working
on my reInvent talks.

I took a "low tech" approach to collecting this data at the end of the year:
I spent about an hour crawling through the past year's meetings on my calendar,
categorized them, and guess-timated how I spent my time during the empty time 
blocks in my calendar. I then used one of my favorite tools
[Infogram](https://infogram.com/) to visualize the data. You can see the full 
infographic here: <https://infogram.com/2019-year-in-review-1hmr6gxgr5g34nl>.

Below is how I defined the set of activities that fall into each bucket. Again,
every PE is unique; these are the activities that I personally spent most of my
time on in 2019:

#### Tech
* Writing and reviewing code & technical designs
* Service operations

#### Product
* Discussions and writing docs related to roadmap and product ideas
* Meeting with customers and partners

#### Project
* "Glue" work
* Project planning
* Getting new features and products shipped
* Keeping teams on track
* Aligning with other teams

#### Team

* One-on-ones

* Recruiting
* Promotion reviews and other talent reviews
* Internal public speaking

#### External
